- Always inside network:
    - sh getBin.sh (create platform-specific binaries)
    - sh deploy_network.sh(beautiful print should show that bynf execution completed)
    - sh deploy_composer.sh (on a separate terminal)
    
- After modifying business-network files in emission-network folder:
    - composer archive create -t dir -n . (move .bna file to the multiorg directory)

The final product, is two business network cards X and Y, the administrator of Org1 and Org 2 respectively. Each organization has 2 peers. To run a second server with Y on a different port:

composer-rest-server -c Y@emission-network -n "never" -p 3001

The Network Admin card is a card that provides access to the deployed business network. The default is that the credentials you supply either by -A/-S or -A/-C when you deploy or start a business network is then bound to in instance of the inbuilt NetworkAdmin Participant type with a name usually the same as that specified in the -A part. To access a business network you have to use an identity that is mapped to a participant.
